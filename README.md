# Mapcell-Checker
Easily compare all installed map mods for Project Zomboid
# How to use
There are multiple ways to use this.
I created an .exe file for ease of use on your machines, if you don't want to install anything. Just run it and follow the instructions.
If you want to run the python file itself, you need to install openpyxl as well.

When run, you will be asked about your workshop folder which you need to select. If your Project Zomboid is located on your C:\ drive, it should be opened almost automatically. The name of the folder is "108600".
My folder is located in here: F:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\workshop\content\108600

Now you have to select any folder on your pc. This is where your .xls file will be generated. Just put it on your desktop for a quick save.

Aaand that's it! When you open up your generated file all used cells will be filled in with the corresponding mod name. If there is more than one mod occupying the same cell, it will be highlighted in red and show all mod names.

# Known issues
If one workshop mod supplies multiple versions of a cell, they will be shown as conflicting. SecretZ is one example of this as it supplies four versions in one, which all occupy the same cells.
# Example Mapcell.xls file
This is a generated file for my subscribed workshop mods, if you want to see how it looks before you try it yourself.
